            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>As you approach the home, pray for the home and for discernment and favor in the conversation. Hello, my name is __________
              and I am here with The Oaks Church. We are a new church in the neighborhood and care deeply about our neighbors. We are also
              starting a community development nonprofit to help meet wholistic needs in our city and we want to learn from neighbors who
              live here before we start anything. Do you have 5 minutes for us to ask you 4 questions about the neighborhood?</p>
